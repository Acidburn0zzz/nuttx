examples
^^^^^^^^

  Selecting examples:

    The examples directory contains several sample applications that
    can be linked with NuttX.  The specific example is selected in the
    configs/<board-name>/defconfig file via the CONFIG_EXAMPLES_xyz
    setting where xyz is the name of the example. For example,

      CONFIG_EXAMPLES_OSTEST=y

    Selects the examples/ostest example.

  Built-In functions

    Some of the examples may be built as "built-in" functions that
    can be executed at run time (rather than as NuttX "main" programs).
    These "built-in" examples can be also be executed from the NuttShell
    (NSH) command line.  In order to configure these built-in  NSH
    functions, you have to set up the following:

    - CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS - Enable support for external registered,
      "named" applications that can be executed from the NSH
      command line (see apps/README.txt for more information).

examples/hello
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  This is the mandatory, "Hello, World!!" example.  It is little more
  than examples/null with a single printf statement.  Really useful only
  for bringing up new NuttX architectures.

  * CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS
    Build the "Hello, World" example as an NSH built-in application.

examples/modbus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  This is a port of the FreeModbus Linux demo.  It derives from the
  demos/LINUX directory of the FreeModBus version 1.5.0 (June 6, 2010)
  that can be downloaded in its entirety from http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6120.

    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODBUS_PORT, Default 0 (for /dev/ttyS0)
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODBUS_BAUD, Default B38400
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODBUS_PARITY, Default MB_PAR_EVEN

    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODBUS_REG_INPUT_START, Default 1000
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODBUS_REG_INPUT_NREGS, Default 4
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODBUS_REG_HOLDING_START, Default 2000
    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_MODBUS_REG_HOLDING_NREGS, Default 130

  The FreeModBus library resides at apps/modbus.  See apps/modbus/README.txt
  for additional configuration information.

examples/nsh
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Basic Configuration
  -------------------
  This directory provides an example of how to configure and use
  the NuttShell (NSH) application.  NSH is a simple shell
  application.  NSH is described in its own README located at
  apps/nshlib/README.txt.  This function is enabled with:

    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH=y

  Applications using this example will need to provide an defconfig
  file in the configuration directory with instruction to build
  the NSH library like:

    CONFIG_NSH_LIBRARY=y

  Other Configuration Requirements
  --------------------------------
  NOTE:  If the NSH serial console is used, then following is also
  required to build the readline() library:

    CONFIG_SYSTEM_READLINE=y

  And if networking is included:

    CONFIG_NETUTILS_NETLIB=y
    CONFIG_NETUTILS_DHCPC=y
    CONFIG_NETUTILS_DNSCLIENT=y
    CONFIG_NETUTILS_TFTPC=y
    CONFIG_NETUTILS_WEBCLIENT=y

  If the Telnet console is enabled, then the defconfig file should
  also include:

    CONFIG_NETUTILS_TELNETD=y

  Also if the Telnet console is enabled, make sure that you have the
  following set in the NuttX configuration file or else the performance
  will be very bad (because there will be only one character per TCP
  transfer):

    CONFIG_STDIO_BUFFER_SIZE - Some value >= 64
    CONFIG_STDIO_LINEBUFFER=y

  C++ Support
  -----------
  If CONFIG_HAVE_CXX=y and CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE=y, then this NSH
  example can be configured to initialize C++ constructors when it
  is started.  NSH does not use C++ and, by default, assumes that
  constructors are initialized elsewhere.  However, you can force
  NSH to initialize constructors by setting:

    CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH_CXXINITIALIZE=y
