dtoa():
^^^^^^

  If you enable floating point conversions with CONFIG_LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT,
  then some files with an unmodified BSD license will be included.  That
  license is similar to the above (modified) BSD license, but has an
  additional requirement that I state the following:

  "This product includes software developed by the University of
   California, Berkeley and its contributors."

libc/math
^^^^^^^^^

  If you enable CONFIG_LIB, you will build the math library at libc/math.
  This library was taken from the math library developed for the Rhombus
  OS by Nick Johnson (https://github.com/nickbjohnson4224/rhombus).  This
  port was contributed by Darcy Gong.  The Rhombus math library has this
  compatible MIT license:
